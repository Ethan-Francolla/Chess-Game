This program is a 2-player interactive chess game created using Python Turtle.
This is a PLTW project for Lesson 1.2.5.

If you have any questions or concerns feel free to email me.

One wierd thing to note about this program is that Python Turtle takes gifs from different folderes depending on the IDE you use to run it.
Running main.py as is will function as normal, but if you use an IDE like Pycharm,
the .gif files will have to be moved to the same exact folder that the main.py file is in.
